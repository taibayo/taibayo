--->The Link Layer
The link layer is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model; it is also referred to in some texts as the network interface layer. The link layer combines the physical and data link layer functions into a single layer. This includes frame physical network functions like modulation, line coding and bit synchronization, frame synchronization and error detection, and LLC and MAC sublayer functions. Common protocols include the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11.
